He rescues her and accompanies her to her parents' home and asks them for her hand in marriage, to which they agree. The marriage takes place with great pomp and ceremony. After the marriage their life is virtually perfect. Then one day, Jalandhar gets a visit from a Sage who tells him that there is war going between the Devas (Gods) and Danavs (Demons), and that Bhagwan Vishnu has been siding with the Devas. Curious to find out more, Jalandhar journeys to his father, Sagar (Ocean), who tells that he had attempted to make peace between the Devas and the Danavs by offering them sweet nectar of life, but Bhagwan Vishnu had taken the shape of a beautiful woman, Mohini, and made sure that only the Devas got the nectar. Jalandhar is angered at this, and declares war against Bhagwan Vishnu and the Devas. Vrunda begs him not to go, as Vishnu is all powerful. When he insists on going, she prays to the Gods and puts a flowered garland (full of blessings) around his neck to ensure his safety. Jalandhar defeats Indra Dev and comes home victorious, along with Indraloks apsaras (beautiful women) and Indrani herself. The enraged Devas appeal to Bhagwan Vishnu, who agrees to do battle with Jalandhar, but again Jalandhar triumphs, and thus becomes Bhagwan Jalandhar. The worried Devas approach Bhagwan Shiv, who refuses to get involved in any war with anyone. In the meantime, Jalandhar gets angry with Vrunda for worshiping Vishnu and cuts her tongue off so as to prevent her from praying. She goes to pray to Vishnu, and he reinstates her tongue. This angers Jalandhar all the more, and in penance Vrunda blinds herself, and is placed in a dungeon surrounded by a wall of fire. Jalandhar now wants the most beautiful woman in the world, and he is told that there is no one more beautiful than Bhagwan Shiva's wife, Parvati. He accordingly sends word for Parvati to come to him. This angers Shiv and he goes to battle Jalandhar. Once again Jalandhar triumphs, and is all set to have Parvati for his own. Parvati and the other Devas now approach Bhagwan Shri Brahma for a solution. In the meantime, Vrunda regains her eyesight, and to her delight finds that Jalandhar has changed, and they spend a lot of time together. Days later, the severed head of Jalandhar comes into their palace, and accuses Vrunda of infidelity. Vrunda is astounded as she has always been true to her husband, but then there was the severed head floating in the air, and there was her husband standing next to her. She soon finds out that the person standing next to her is Bhagwan Vishnu who had assumed the form of Jalandhar, the real Jalandhar had been defeated by Bhagwan Shiv in battle, and his head severed from his body. Now Bhagwan Vishnu and the Devas have to content with Vrunda's wrath - and she wills Vishnu to become of stone for pulling wool over her eyes, and then she turns her wrath on the rest of the Devas. Will anyone or anything be able to stop Vrunda?",27,3655

With various outfits of terrorism spreading its tentacles across the world this three centuries old quote of Denis Diderot seems to be apt and as contemporary as it can be. With vulnerable youths falling for the stories of getting an opportunity to work for Allah and empowered with thoughts that your hands will kill the innocent but Allah will forgive all has given these youths the notion that all is fair on the course of Jihad. In the history of mankind, fanaticism has caused more harm than any vice. Despite a space of several years the wounds inflicted by the Indian army in Kashmir were still fresh in Altaaf's mind when he joined the terrorist outfit with the pious thoughts of wiping away the enemies of Islam. Little did he know that he had in turn, gullibly fallen into the trap of people with vested interest and crooked ideas. During one of his assignments Altaaf meets Bhavna, widow of a doctor they had once killed on the suspicion of being an informer of the army. Holed out at Bhavna's house, Altaaf undergoes a metamorphosis as he witnesses Bhavna's plight and helplessness. History however, is replete with the stories of Jihadis or the soldiers of the Holy War, who at some point during their fight for religion realize that they have taken an erroneous decision. Realize that bullets can win wars but not hearts and in the bargain comprehend that they are treading on a path of no return. Jihad is the journey of the militant Altaaf and his realization of the futility of his holy war as he stumbles upon a few truths. That unfortunately Jihad is generally misunderstood to be true Islam. Whereas Islam stands for humanity. Islam prevails amidst brotherhood of people. And Altaaf also learns the supreme truth. That the true meaning of Jihad is not the holy war outside but the war within. Jihad is nothing but overpowering your inner devil. Firearms can give death, not life. Impart life if you can..!!.

Just as Sunny is cynical about life, Michael Burnett (Boman Irani) is optimistic about it. 51 year old Michael is a simple minded man, almost childlike and has recently landed job as a pizza delivery boy at Mummy's Pizza. Michael has sort of an inclination to lose every job he has ever had in 2 days flat. This time, however, he vows to keep this one no matter what. On the eve of Diwali, Sunny has loads of stuff to do and very little time to do it. He has to meet his screenplay deadline, he has to get rid of Pandey (Saurabh Shukla) his irritatingly intrusive next door neighbor and he's got to avoid his editor's telephone calls who is livid that he's bunking work. But more importantly he needs to get Jenny out of the way because he has a date with Maya (Mahima Chaudhary), a South Indian superstar who he has been in love with since as long as he can remember. In this confusion, Sunny forgets that there is no food in his bachelor pad and orders a pizza that Michael is given the task of delivering. And what Michael delivers to Sunny is so much more than just a pizza. Sunny is home delivered life's simple lessons right to his doorstep.",656,4170

4302,Itanagar 0KM,2015,,9.3, (11),"Produced by Alison Welly, ""Itanagar 0KM"" depicts the story of young a man and his struggle. Though Heartbroken and shattered; the film gives clue that he has a good life ahead.

The major chunk has been given to unemployment problem. The protagonist does not sit idle waiting for some politician's help or any miracles to happen. In spite, he does all odd works including selling bamboo, giving tuition, engaging in poultry farm, even work as a cobbler but succeeds in none. Chima's (protagonist) struggles are symbol of every youth's struggle giving a message not to surrender during adversity.

It is a story of a youth named Chime charmingly played by Tai Tugung who strives to make two ends meet and the journey of his topsy-turvy life. The audience gets a front-row seat as the film starts with heart touching dialogue between young friends Jumar and Chime through a letter, talking about the brighter and darker side of life that is offered to them separately. The film goes on from a small start of the difficult life of a child (chime) who works hard to find a job -to the ripple effects of unemployment in grown up Chime's life. Scoring some great emotional points, the central character Chime touches the heart of the audience with his natural performance. The characterisations have strong connecting points; opposite Tai Tugung is Nabam Ana who plays the role of Margam and is seen flaunting her kindness to support a struggler. Itanagar 0 Km, in a way, appears to be a reminisce of road trip films that have recently captured the imagination of Bollywood film-makers. The Bollywood industry that ranges from subject matters like corruption, an honest cop beating out the bad man, a common man's fight against the system have now ventured into this road trips genre. Itanagar 0 Km is close to that, having revealing moments like those of road trip movies where the protagonist's emotions are expressed in the short ride he takes, be it with his friend or wandering alone in the roadsides to riding back home after ""The Revelation"". Critics may judge minus for some stereotypes in the film. Apart from emotional outbursts, there are some jaw-cracking moments in the film that give the audience no time to adjust to the ¬giggle wavelength. The film is supported with melodious Hindi songs offering the conventional touch of Bollywood films to the audience. The makers of the film are confident that the people of the state will accept the film for its storyline more so for the Arunachalee brand of Hindi that is used in the film. This movie is based on a true story reflecting the contemporary society with special focus on the youth of our society, said the producer of the film Allison Welly on the premier night. Expressing much satisfaction with the release of Itanagar 0 Km, the proprietor of Cinepolis 3D Nending Lahzeey said that Cinepolis is lucky enough to have a role in promoting regional films, thereby encouraging local film-makers. The film is a testimony of a hard working team led by director Tai Gungte, trying to notch up a level in the Arunachal film industry.
